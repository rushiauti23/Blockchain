# BlockChain

This is a simple project showcasing how the Blockchain works. What is the concept behind the blockchain. Project includes the methods and classes to validate the chain.

## What is my motivation behind this project?

The motivation is simple, learning and upskilling. I come from a non tech back ground. So, I am trying my best to learn small things on my own with inspirations from various places(Tech blogs, YouTube, Articles)

## What Problem does it solve.
As such it does not solve any real world problem, but it does reduce my fear of coding myself and boosts the confidence in me.

## What did I learn
1. How blockchains work?
2. Structure of the blockchains.
3. How simple is it to create a blockchain
4. How to validate the blockchain?
5. What is proof of work?


## Features
```java
// this method is a class to create a new block to add in the blockchain 
public class Block{}

//this method will calculate the hash or signature of the block
public String calculateHash(){}

//this class contains the method to calculate the hash
public class StringUtil {
   public static String applySha256(String input){
     /*** 
     Code to calculate the hash
     ***/
   }
}

//Class of the blockchain RushChain
public class RushChain {}

```
